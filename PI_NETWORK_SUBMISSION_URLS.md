# 🥧 Pi Network App Submission - ChordyPi URLs

## 📋 Fill in the Pi Network Developer Portal Form

Based on your screenshot, here are the EXACT URLs to use:

---

### ✅ **App Hosting**
```
Self Hosted
```

---

### ✅ **Your App's URL**
**IMPORTANT:** Use your Railway URL once deployed!

**TEMPORARY (until Railway is ready):**
```
https://chordypi.vercel.app
```

**AFTER RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT:**
```
https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app
```
*(Replace with your actual Railway URL after deployment completes)*

---

### ✅ **Your App's Development URL**
```
https://localhost:3000
```

---

### ✅ **App's Privacy Policy URL**

**TEMPORARY (using Vercel frontend):**
```
https://chordypi.vercel.app/legal/privacy-policy.html
```

**AFTER RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT (recommended):**
```
https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/legal/privacy-policy.html
```

**Note:** Railway backend serves these legal docs directly, which is better for Pi Network compliance!

---

### ✅ **App's Terms of Service URL**

**TEMPORARY (using Vercel frontend):**
```
https://chordypi.vercel.app/legal/terms-of-service.html
```

**AFTER RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT (recommended):**
```
https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/legal/terms-of-service.html
```
