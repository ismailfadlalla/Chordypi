# 🔧 RAILWAY AUTO-DEPLOY NOT WORKING - MANUAL DEPLOY REQUIRED

## Issue
Railway is not automatically deploying when you push to GitHub.

## Why This Happens
1. **GitHub Webhook Not Configured** - Railway hasn't set up webhook on your repo
2. **Auto-Deploy Disabled** - Setting might be turned off in Railway
3. **Branch Mismatch** - Railway watching wrong branch
4. **GitHub App Permissions** - Railway doesn't have proper access

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: Manual Deploy (2 Minutes)

### Option 1: Railway Dashboard (EASIEST)

**Steps:**
1. Go to: **https://railway.app**
2. Login to your account
3. Click: **Chordypi** project (or whatever you named it)
4. Click on your **service** (should show GitHub icon)
5. Look for **"Deployments"** tab at the top
6. Click: **"Deploy"** or **"New Deployment"** button
7. Select: **main** branch
8. Wait ~3-5 minutes for build to complete

**OR if you see a different UI:**
1. In Railway dashboard → Your service
2. Click **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll down to find **"Redeploy"** button
4. Click it
5. Confirm

---

### Option 2: Railway CLI (If You Have It)

```powershell
# Install Railway CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Deploy
railway up
```

## 🔍 Enable Auto-Deploy for Future

After manual deploy works, enable auto-deploy:

### In Railway Dashboard:

1. Go to: **Settings** tab
2. Find: **"Source"** or **"GitHub"** section
3. Look for: **"Auto Deploy"** toggle
4. Make sure it's: **ON** ✅
5. Verify: **Branch** = `main`
6. Verify: **Root Directory** = `server` ⚠️ **CRITICAL!**

### Check GitHub Connection:

1. Settings → Source
2. Should show: `GitHub: ismailfadlalla/Chordypi`
3. If not:
   - Click "Disconnect"
   - Click "Connect GitHub Repo"
   - Select: `ismailfadlalla/Chordypi`
   - Branch: `main`
   - ✅ Enable "Auto Deploy"

## ⏱️ Deployment Timeline (Manual Deploy)

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| 0:00 | Click "Deploy" button |
| 0:30 | Railway pulls from GitHub |
| 1:00 | Starts installing dependencies |
| 3:00 | Installing TensorFlow 2.15.0 (large package) |
| 4:00 | Building application |
| 4:30 | Starting server |
| 5:00 | ✅ **LIVE!** |

**Total**: ~5 minutes

## 🧪 How to Know It's Working

### During Deployment (Railway Logs):

Look for these in the **Logs** section:
```
📦 Installing dependencies from requirements.txt
   Collecting tensorflow==2.15.0
   Collecting basic-pitch>=0.2.5
   Collecting protobuf==3.20.3
   ✅ Successfully installed tensorflow-2.15.0

🚀 Starting application
   🧹 CLEARING PYTHON BYTECODE CACHE
   🚀 APP.PY STARTING - ChordyPi v3.0 with RapidAPI
   ✅ Basic Pitch AI model available
   🎵 Enhanced Chord Detector initialized with Basic Pitch AI
   
   * Running on http://0.0.0.0:$PORT
   ✅ Service is live!
```

### Deployment Status:
- 🟡 **Building...** - Installing dependencies
- 🟡 **Deploying...** - Starting server
- 🟢 **Success** - Ready to test!
- 🔴 **Failed** - Check logs for errors

---

## ✅ Test After Deployment

### 1. Health Check (Immediate)
```powershell
curl https://chordypi-production.up.railway.app/api/health
```

**Expected**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "ChordyPi API is running"
}
```

### 2. Test File Upload (Main Fix)
1. Go to: **https://chordypi.vercel.app**
2. Search: "wonderwall" (or any song)
3. Click: **"📁 Upload Audio File"**
4. Select: Any MP3, WAV, or M4A file
5. **Expected**:
   - ✅ No 415 error
   - ✅ Analysis starts (progress bar)
   - ✅ Chord progressions appear
   - ✅ Shows "AI-Enhanced (Basic Pitch)"

### 3. Check Response (DevTools)
Press **F12** → **Network** tab → Upload file

**Response should include**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "chords": [...],
  "analysis_type": "AI-Enhanced (Basic Pitch)",
  "accuracy": 90,
  "method": "basic_pitch",
  "source": "user_upload"
}
```

## 🚨 If Deployment Fails

### Common Issues:

**1. "Module not found" Error**
- **Fix**: Check Root Directory = `server` in Settings

**2. "Port binding" Error**
- **Fix**: Ensure `PORT` environment variable is set

**3. TensorFlow Installation Timeout**
- **Fix**: This is normal - just redeploy, Railway caches it

**4. "No such file" Error**
- **Fix**: Verify all files are in GitHub repo

### Check Railway Logs:
1. Click on failed deployment
2. Click "View Logs"
3. Look for error messages (usually in red)
4. Share error here if you need help
