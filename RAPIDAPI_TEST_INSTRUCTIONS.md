# RapidAPI Test Instructions - Quick Verification

## üß™ Test If RapidAPI Is Working

You said the RAPIDAPI_KEY is already set in Railway. Let's verify it's actually working!

### Method 1: Use the Test Page (EASIEST)

**After Vercel deploys (2-3 minutes), visit**:
```
https://chordypi.vercel.app/test-rapidapi.html
```

**Click the button** and it will tell you if RapidAPI is:
- ‚úÖ Configured correctly
- ‚úÖ API key valid
- ‚úÖ YouTube downloads working
- ‚ùå OR what's wrong if it fails

### Method 2: Direct API Test

Open your browser and visit:
```
https://chordypi-production.up.railway.app/api/test-rapidapi
```

**Expected Success Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "‚úÖ RapidAPI is configured and working!",
  "details": {
    "status": "success",
    "message": "RapidAPI YouTube downloader working!",
    "test_title": "Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up",
    "test_duration": 213
  }
}
```

**If It Fails**, you'll see:
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "‚ùå RapidAPI test failed",
  "details": {
    "status": "error",
    "message": "RAPIDAPI_KEY not found in environment",
    "solution": "Add RAPIDAPI_KEY to Railway environment variables"
  }
}
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "RAPIDAPI_KEY not found"

5. Click "Redeploy" to apply changes

### Issue 2: "API error: 403" or "API error: 429"
**Possible Causes**:
- **403**: Invalid API key
- **429**: Exceeded 500 downloads/month quota

**Solution**:
- Check if key is correct: `223a06cc75msh57f8d4c86ec93ap17fe60jsn29b4702d5ca8`
- Check RapidAPI dashboard for usage limits

### Issue 3: "Network error" or "Timeout"
