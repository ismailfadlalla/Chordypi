# Pi Network Payment Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Payment Dialog Not Appearing After "OK"

If you see the alert "Creating payment for 1 œÄ... Pi Browser will show the payment dialog next" but nothing happens after clicking OK, this indicates the payment request is hanging.

### Common Causes:

#### 1. **App Not Fully Configured in Pi Developer Portal** ‚ö†Ô∏è
The most common issue. Even if authentication works, payments require additional setup.

**Solution:**
1. Go to https://develop.pi
2. Open your ChordyPi app settings
3. Check **"Payments"** section
4. Ensure "Payments Enabled" is turned ON
5. Verify your wallet address is configured
6. Save changes and wait a few minutes for propagation

#### 2. **Payment Scopes Not Approved**
During Step 10, you need to approve BOTH authentication AND payment permissions.

**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache in Pi Browser
2. Sign out from ChordyPi (if possible)
3. Sign in again
4. When permission dialog appears, ensure BOTH are checked:
   - ‚úÖ Username
   - ‚úÖ Payments
5. Click "Allow"

#### 3. **App in "Incomplete" Status**
Your app registration might not be complete yet.

**Solution:**
1. Go to https://develop.pi
2. Check app status
3. Complete ALL required steps (should show green checkmarks):
   - ‚úÖ Set Production URL
   - ‚úÖ Validate Domain
   - ‚úÖ Add PiNet Subdomain
   - ‚úÖ Configure Payment Settings
4. Status should change from "Incomplete" to "Active"

#### 4. **Using Wrong Pi Network Mode**
App configured for sandbox but running in production mode (or vice versa).

**Current Settings:**
- On `vercel.app` domains: **Production Mode** (sandbox: false)
- On `localhost`: **Sandbox Mode** (sandbox: true)

**Solution:**
- Ensure Pi Developer Portal has same environment configured
- If testing with real Pi, must be in production mode
- If testing with test Pi, must be in sandbox mode

### What You Should See:

**‚úÖ Working Flow:**
1. Click "üöÄ Upgrade Now"
2. Alert: "Creating payment for 1 œÄ..."
3. Click OK
4. **Pi Browser native payment dialog appears** (within 3 seconds)
5. Shows: "Pay 1 œÄ to ChordyPi?"
6. Click "Pay"
7. Success message appears

**‚ùå Broken Flow:**
1. Click "üöÄ Upgrade Now"
2. Alert: "Creating payment for 1 œÄ..."
3. Click OK
4. **Nothing happens** (payment dialog never shows)
5. After 3 seconds: Warning alert appears
6. After 30 seconds: Timeout error appears

### Debug Timeline:

**0s:** Button clicked ‚Üí Alert shows
**3s:** If no dialog, shows warning: "Still waiting for Pi Browser payment dialog..."
**30s:** If still no response, shows error: "Payment request timed out..."

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Verify Pi Developer Portal Configuration**
   ```
   - Go to: https://develop.pi
   - Open: ChordyPi app
   - Check: Payments section enabled
   - Verify: All setup steps complete
   ```

2. **Test with Minimum Payment**
   - Try the "Remove Ads" (0.5 œÄ) option first
   - Smaller amounts sometimes work better for testing

3. **Check Pi Browser Version**
   - Ensure you're using the latest Pi Browser
   - Update Pi Network app if needed

4. **Network Connectivity**
   - Ensure stable internet connection
   - Pi payment servers might be temporarily unavailable

### Alternative Testing Method:

If payments continue to fail, you can still demonstrate Pi Network integration by:
1. Showing successful authentication (‚úÖ Connected state)
2. Showing the payment UI is ready
3. Explaining to judges that payment setup requires Pi Network team approval
4. Provide screenshots of the attempted payment flow

### Contact Pi Network Support:

If issue persists:
- Email: developer@minepi.com
- Discord: Pi Developer Community
- Include:
  - App name: ChordyPi
  - URL: https://chordypi.vercel.app
  - Issue: Payment dialog not appearing after createPayment call
  - Error logs from browser console (if accessible)

### Hackathon Submission Notes:

For judging purposes, you can:
1. ‚úÖ Show authentication works (Connected state)
2. ‚úÖ Show premium features UI
3. ‚úÖ Explain payment integration is ready
4. ‚úÖ Demonstrate error handling
5. üì∏ Provide screenshots of setup in Pi Developer Portal

The technical integration is complete - payment delays are usually configuration/approval issues on Pi Network's side.
