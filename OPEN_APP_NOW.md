## 🎯 URLs to Try

Open these in your browser:

1. **Main App:** https://localhost:3000
2. **API Health Check:** https://localhost:5000/api/health
3. **Featured Songs:** https://localhost:5000/api/featured-songs
4. **Alt Server:** https://localhost:3443

(Accept SSL warnings for each)

---

## 🐛 If Still Seeing Blank Page

1. **Open Browser DevTools (F12)**
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for errors (red text)
4. Take screenshot and share with me

**Common fixes:**
- Hard refresh: **Ctrl+Shift+R**
- Clear cache: **Ctrl+Shift+Delete**
- Try different browser

---

## ✅ Confirmation Test

Type this in browser console (F12 → Console):
```javascript
document.getElementById('root')
```

**Should show:** `<div id="root">...</div>` with content

**If empty:** React isn't rendering - check console for errors

---

## 📊 Your Terminal Confirms It Works!

```
✅ webpack 5.101.3 compiled successfully
✅ 127.0.0.1 - "POST /api/analyze-song HTTP/1.1" 200
✅ 127.0.0.1 - "GET /api/featured-songs HTTP/1.1" 200
```

The app IS working! Just need to view it in a regular browser that can bypass the SSL warning.

---

**TL;DR:** Open Chrome/Edge/Firefox, go to `https://localhost:3000`, click "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost", and the app will load! 🚀
