## 🔐 **6. SECURITY CHECK**

### Files That Should NOT Be Committed:
- [ ] `.env` is in `.gitignore` ✅
- [ ] `__pycache__/` is in `.gitignore` ✅
- [ ] `node_modules/` is in `.gitignore` ✅
- [ ] API keys are NOT in any committed files ✅

### Verify .gitignore:
```bash
# Check .gitignore contains:
.env
.env.local
*.pyc
__pycache__/
node_modules/
.DS_Store
```

---

## 🎯 **7. DEPLOYMENT ORDER**

### Recommended Sequence:
1. **GitHub**: ✅ All changes pushed
2. **Railway**: Deploy backend FIRST (need URL for frontend)
3. **Get Railway URL**: Copy the deployed URL
4. **Update Vercel**: Update `VITE_API_URL` with Railway URL
5. **Vercel**: Deploy or redeploy frontend
6. **Test**: Verify everything works
7. **Pi Network**: Submit app to developer portal

---

## 🧪 **8. PRE-DEPLOYMENT TESTS**

### Test Locally First:
```bash
# Backend:
cd server
python app.py
# Visit: http://localhost:5000/api/health
# Visit: http://localhost:5000/legal/terms-of-service.html

# Frontend:
cd client
npm run dev
# Visit: http://localhost:3000
# Test: Analyze a song
```

### Expected Local Results:
- [ ] Backend `/api/health` returns JSON
- [ ] Legal docs load at `/legal/` routes
- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] Can navigate between pages
- [ ] No console errors

---

## ⚠️ **9. COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID**

### Railway:
- ❌ **Forgetting to set Root Directory to `server`** (MOST COMMON ERROR!)
- ❌ Not setting `RAPIDAPI_KEY` environment variable
- ❌ Using wrong Python version (must be 3.10+)

### Vercel:
- ❌ Adding API keys to frontend environment variables
- ❌ Not setting all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
- ❌ Wrong API URL format (must include `/api` at end)

### Pi Network:
- ❌ Legal documents not accessible
- ❌ Using HTTP instead of HTTPS
- ❌ Pi SDK not loaded in HTML

---

## 📊 **10. FINAL VERIFICATION COMMANDS**

### Check Git Status:
```bash
cd E:\ChordyPiProject\ChordyPi
git status
# Should show: "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

git log --oneline -5
# Should show recent commits with legal docs and Pi SDK
```

### Check File Structure:
```bash
# Run these to verify structure:
ls server/
ls server/legal/
ls client/public/
ls client/public/legal/
```

### Check Environment Files:
```bash
cat client/.env.production
# Should NOT contain any API keys

cat client/.env.example
# Should be template only
```
