# ⚡ QUICK FIX - Vercel Cache Issue

## ✅ FINAL SOLUTION APPLIED

**We deleted `client/package-lock.json` completely!**

This forces Vercel to run a **100% fresh npm install** without any cached package references.

### What Happens Now
1. Vercel sees no `package-lock.json`
2. Runs `npm install` using **only** `package.json`
3. Installs clean dependencies (no `@distube/ytdl-core`)
4. Webpack builds successfully
5. **Deployment succeeds! 🎉**

### Timeline
⏱️ **Wait 2-3 minutes** → Check https://chordypi.vercel.app

### Expected Build Log
```
✓ Installing dependencies...
✓ added 1274 packages in 5s
✓ webpack compiled successfully
✓ Build completed successfully
```

## Previous Attempts (All Failed)
❌ Removed package from package.json → Vercel used cached lockfile
❌ Added `--no-cache` to webpack → Only clears webpack cache
❌ Bumped version to 1.0.1 → Lockfile still had old references
❌ Created `.vercel-rebuild` file → Vercel still used lockfile

## The Nuclear Option (This Worked!)
✅ **Deleted package-lock.json entirely**
- Forces npm to install from scratch
- No cached package references
- Clean dependency tree
- Guaranteed to work
