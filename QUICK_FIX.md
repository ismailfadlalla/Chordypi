# ⚡ QUICK FIX - Vercel Cache Issue

## The Problem
Vercel build fails with errors about `@distube/ytdl-core` and `audioExtractor.js` - **files we already deleted!**

## The Cause
**Vercel's build cache** still contains the old files from the previous failed build.

## The Solution

### Option 1: Manual Redeploy (90 seconds)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your project → **Deployments**
3. Latest deployment → **"..."** menu → **"Redeploy"**
4. ⚠️ **UNCHECK** "Use existing build cache" ⚠️
5. Click **"Redeploy"**

### Option 2: Wait (2-3 minutes)
Just wait! The `--no-cache` flag we added should work automatically.

## What We Already Fixed
✅ Deleted `audioExtractor.js`
✅ Removed `@distube/ytdl-core` package
✅ Added `--no-cache` to webpack
✅ Bumped version to 1.0.1
✅ Pushed to GitHub

## Expected Result
```
✓ webpack compiled successfully
✓ Build completed
```

## Still Failing?
See **VERCEL_CACHE_CLEAR_GUIDE.md** for detailed troubleshooting.
