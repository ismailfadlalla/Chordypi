# 🔍 Blank Page Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Blank Page at https://localhost:3000

The servers are running successfully (Python API is processing requests), but you're seeing a blank page. Here are the solutions:

---

## ✅ Solution 1: Accept SSL Certificate (Most Likely)

The app uses HTTPS with self-signed certificates. You need to:

1. **Close the Simple Browser in VS Code**
2. **Open in your regular browser** (Chrome/Edge/Firefox)
3. Navigate to: `https://localhost:3000`
4. You'll see a security warning
5. Click **"Advanced"** or **"Show Details"**
6. Click **"Proceed to localhost (unsafe)"** or **"Accept Risk and Continue"**
7. The app should load!

**Why:** Self-signed SSL certificates trigger browser security warnings. The VS Code Simple Browser may not allow you to bypass this.

---

## ✅ Solution 2: Check Browser Console

If still blank after accepting certificate:

1. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
2. Click the **Console** tab
3. Look for errors (red text)
4. Common issues:
   - CSP (Content Security Policy) errors
   - Module loading errors
   - React rendering errors

**Send me the console errors if you see any!**

---

## ✅ Solution 3: Hard Refresh

The browser might be caching an old version:

1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)
2. Or press **Ctrl+F5**
3. This forces a hard refresh without cache

---

## ✅ Solution 4: Clear Browser Cache

1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+Delete**
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Clear for "Last hour"
4. Reload the page

---

## ✅ Solution 5: Check If React Dev Server Actually Started

Look at the terminal output and confirm you see:

```
[REACT] webpack 5.101.3 compiled successfully in 1908 ms
```

**Status:** ✅ YES - This line appears in your terminal, so React is running!

---

## ✅ Solution 6: Try HTTP Instead (Fallback)

If HTTPS issues persist:

1. Stop all servers (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. Edit `webpack.config.js` to disable HTTPS temporarily:
   - Comment out the `server` section
   - Change port or use HTTP

**Note:** Pi Network requires HTTPS, so this is just for testing!

---

## 🎯 Most Likely Cause

Based on your terminal output showing successful compilation and API requests, the app **IS working**. The blank page is likely because:

1. **SSL Certificate Warning**: VS Code Simple Browser can't bypass it
2. **Solution**: Open `https://localhost:3000` in Chrome/Edge/Firefox and accept the security warning

---

## 🧪 Quick Test

Open these URLs in your **regular browser** (not VS Code Simple Browser):

1. **React App:** https://localhost:3000
   - Should show ChordyPi homepage
   - Accept SSL warning

2. **API Health:** https://localhost:5000/api/health
   - Should show: `{"status": "ok"}`
   - Accept SSL warning

3. **Featured Songs:** https://localhost:5000/api/featured-songs
   - Should return JSON with songs
   - Accept SSL warning

---

## 📊 Terminal Confirms App is Working!

Your terminal shows:
```
✅ React development server is ready!
[REACT] webpack 5.101.3 compiled successfully
[PYTHON] 127.0.0.1 - - [06/Oct/2025 10:16:50] "GET /api/featured-songs HTTP/1.1" 200
```

This means:
- ✅ React compiled and is serving
- ✅ Python API is responding to requests
- ✅ The app IS working, just need to view it correctly!

---

## 🚀 Recommended Action

**Open Chrome/Edge/Firefox** and navigate to:
```
https://localhost:3000
```

1. You'll see: "Your connection is not private" or similar
2. Click "Advanced"
3. Click "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)"
4. **The app should load!**

---

## 🐛 If Still Blank After Above Steps

1. **Check browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
2. **Take a screenshot** of any errors
3. **Check Network tab** (F12 → Network tab)
   - Do you see requests to `bundle.js`?
   - Are they succeeding (status 200)?

4. **Verify root element**:
   - In Console tab, type: `document.getElementById('root')`
   - Should show: `<div id="root">...</div>` with content

---

## 💡 Alternative: Use Node.js HTTPS Server

If React dev server issues persist, use the Node.js server which serves the production build:

```
https://localhost:3443
```

This serves the production bundle from `server/web-build/` and might work better with self-signed certs.

## ✅ Expected Result

Once you bypass SSL warning in a regular browser, you should see:

```
╔════════════════════════════════════╗
║    🎸 ChordyPi Homepage 🎸         ║
║                                    ║
║    Search bar                      ║
║    Featured songs                  ║
║    "Connect Pi Wallet" button      ║
║    Footer with branding            ║
╔════════════════════════════════════╝
```

---

**Next Step:** Open `https://localhost:3000` in Chrome, Edge, or Firefox (not VS Code Simple Browser) and accept the SSL certificate warning!
