2. Click "**+ New Variable**"
3. Add:
   - Name: `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`
   - Value: `AIzaSyCNBzdkGau4j1nKzZUm6AjLv8FPB1mj_Gs`

## 🐛 If Still Getting 415 Error After Deploy

**Wait for deployment to finish!**

Check Railway:
- Status should be "**Live**" (green)
- Deployment should show "**Success**"
- Time: Latest deployment should be very recent

**Then try upload again**

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:
- ✅ Railway shows "Success" status
- ✅ Upload doesn't show 415 error
- ✅ File analysis starts (may show processing overlay)
- ✅ Chords detected from uploaded file

---

**Monitor**: https://railway.app → Chordypi → Deployments

**ETA**: ~2 minutes until file upload works! 🎸

**Add YouTube key now while waiting!** ⬆️
