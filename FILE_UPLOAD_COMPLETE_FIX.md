# File Upload - Complete Fix Summary

## Problem
File uploads were failing with multiple errors:
1. **415 Unsupported Media Type** - Backend couldn't detect file uploads
2. **500 Internal Server Error** - Railway was serving stale/cached code
3. **400 Bad Request** - Frontend flow was incorrect
4. **"history.push is not a function"** - Navigation error

## Root Causes

### 1. Railway Not Deploying New Code
- **Issue**: Railway's auto-deploy wasn't working
- **Symptom**: Changes pushed to GitHub but Railway kept serving old code
- **Evidence**: Startup logs showed "v3.0" instead of "v3.0.1-FORCE-REBUILD-20251009"
- **Fix**: Manually triggered deployment from Railway dashboard

### 2. Frontend Flow Was Wrong
- **Issue**: File upload tried to analyze BEFORE navigating to AnalyzingPage
- **Old Flow**: Upload → API call → Navigate (WRONG)
- **New Flow**: Upload → Navigate to AnalyzingPage → API call (CORRECT)
- **Files Changed**:
  - `client/src/pages/SearchResultsPage.jsx` - Navigate with file data
  - `client/src/pages/AnalyzingPage.jsx` - Detect file uploads and call `analyzeUploadedAudio()`

### 3. Vercel Not Auto-Deploying
- **Issue**: Vercel's auto-deploy not triggering on GitHub pushes
- **Fix**: Manual deployment required from Vercel dashboard

## Files Modified

### Backend
1. **server/routes/analysis.py**
   - Added `logger.error()` debug logging (lines 1-40)
   - Added check for `request.is_json` before accessing `request.json` (line 42)
   - Prevents 415 error when non-JSON requests arrive

2. **server/app.py**
   - Added `@app.before_request` logging middleware
   - Added `/api/test-upload` endpoint for debugging
   - Added global error handler
   - Added version marker: `v3.0.1-logger-debug`
   - Added deployment version: `v3.0.1-FORCE-REBUILD-20251009`

### Frontend
1. **client/src/pages/SearchResultsPage.jsx** (Commit 8cd57f0)
   - Changed `handleFileUpload()` to use `onSongSelect(song)` callback
   - Passes song object with `source: 'upload'`, `fileData`, `fileName`
   - No longer calls API directly

2. **client/src/pages/AnalyzingPage.jsx** (Commit 38403cd)
   - Added import: `analyzeUploadedAudio`
   - Added file upload detection: `if (song.source === 'upload' && song.fileData)`
   - Calls `analyzeUploadedAudio()` for uploaded files
   - Calls `analyzeSong()` for YouTube videos

## Correct Flow Now

### YouTube Songs (Working)
```
Search → Select song → Navigate to /analyzing → 
AnalyzingPage detects YouTube → Call analyzeSong() → 
Show overlay (5s min) → Navigate to /player with chords
```

### File Uploads (Now Fixed)
```
Upload file → handleFileUpload() creates song object → 
Call onSongSelect(song) → Navigate to /analyzing → 
AnalyzingPage detects upload → Call analyzeUploadedAudio() → 
Show overlay (5s min) → Navigate to /player with chords
```

## Deployment Issues Encountered

### Railway
- **Problem**: Auto-deploy from GitHub not working
- **Solution**: Manual "Redeploy" from Railway dashboard
- **How to Check**: Look for version in startup logs or health endpoint
- **Settings**: Source → Make sure Auto Deploy is enabled for `main` branch

### Vercel
- **Problem**: Auto-deploy from GitHub not working
- **Solution**: Manual "Redeploy" from Vercel dashboard
- **How to Trigger**: Deployments tab → Click deployment → Redeploy button

## Current Status

✅ **Backend (Railway)**
- Deployment: `706b80b` - "Add deployment version marker to startup"
- Status: LIVE (manually deployed)
- File upload endpoint: Working
- AI detection: Basic Pitch with TensorFlow 2.15.0

⏳ **Frontend (Vercel)**
- Latest Commit: `8cd57f0` - "Fix file upload: use onSongSelect callback"
- Status: NEEDS MANUAL DEPLOYMENT
- Auto-deploy: Not working
- Action Required: Manually deploy from Vercel dashboard

## Testing Checklist

After Vercel deploys:

1. ✅ Go to https://chordypi.vercel.app
2. ✅ Search for a song (e.g., "wonderwall")
3. ✅ Click "Upload Audio File" 
4. ✅ Select an MP3/WAV file
5. ✅ Should see AnalyzingPage overlay
6. ✅ Should see progress animation
7. ✅ Should navigate to PlayerPage with chords
8. ✅ Should show "AI-Enhanced (Basic Pitch)" analysis type
9. ✅ Should display chord progression with 90%+ accuracy

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Deploy Vercel** - Use dashboard to deploy commit `8cd57f0`
2. **Test File Upload** - Verify complete flow works
3. **Check Railway Logs** - Confirm AI detection working
4. **Enable Auto-Deploy** - Fix GitHub webhooks for Railway & Vercel
5. **Pi Network Submission** - Ready for hackathon (6 days remaining)

## Commits History

Recent commits (most recent first):
- `97d1829` - Force Vercel deployment - file upload fixes (empty)
- `8cd57f0` - Fix file upload: use onSongSelect callback instead of history.push
- `38403cd` - Fix file upload flow - navigate to AnalyzingPage first, then analyze
- `706b80b` - Add deployment version marker to startup
- `fe88023` - Use logger.error() instead of print() to ensure logs appear
- `6063578` - Add before_request logging and test-upload endpoint

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify deployments** - Check version markers or timestamps
2. **Railway & Vercel auto-deploy can fail** - Keep manual deploy as backup
3. **Frontend flow matters** - Must navigate THEN call API, not vice versa
4. **Logging is critical** - Use `logger.error()` to ensure logs appear
5. **Test with manual triggers** - Don't rely solely on webhooks
