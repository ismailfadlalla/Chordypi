# 🚂 Railway Deployment Guide - ChordyPi Backend

## ⚡ Quick Deploy (10 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- ✅ Railway account (you have this!)
- ✅ GitHub repo connected (ismailfadlalla/Chordypi)
- ✅ RapidAPI key ready: `223e06cc75msha57f8d4c86ec93ap17fe60jsn29b4702d5ca8`

---

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Deployment

### STEP 1: Create New Railway Project

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Choose: `ismailfadlalla/Chordypi`
5. Name it: **"ChordyPi-Backend"**

### STEP 2: Configure Root Directory

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Railway needs to know we're deploying from the `/server` folder!

1. In Railway dashboard, click **"Settings"**
2. Find **"Root Directory"** section
3. Set to: `server`
4. Click **"Save"**

### STEP 3: Set Environment Variables

Click **"Variables"** tab and add these:

```bash
RAPIDAPI_KEY=223e06cc75msha57f8d4c86ec93ap17fe60jsn29b4702d5ca8
PORT=5000
FLASK_ENV=production
```

### STEP 4: Verify Build Settings

Railway auto-detects Python projects. Verify:

- ✅ **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (auto-detected)
- ✅ **Start Command**: `python app.py` (from Procfile)
- ✅ **Python Version**: 3.10.0 (from runtime.txt)

### STEP 5: Deploy!

1. Click **"Deploy"** button
2. Watch the build logs
3. Wait for: **"Your service is live! 🎉"**
4. Copy the Railway URL (e.g., `https://chordypi-backend-production.up.railway.app`)

## 🔍 Verify Deployment

### Test 1: Health Check
Open in browser:
```
https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/health
```

Should return:
```json
{"status": "healthy", "message": "ChordyPi API is running"}
```

### Test 2: Analyze a Song
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/api/analyze-song \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOn-HdEg6AQ"}'
```

**Look for in Railway logs:**
```
🔥 AUDIO_PROCESSOR.PY LOADED - VERSION 2 WITH RAPIDAPI DEBUG
🔴 ABOUT TO CALL download_youtube_audio()
🚀 Trying RapidAPI YouTube MP3 Downloader...
✅ RapidAPI download successful!
```

---

## 🎨 Update Frontend (Connect to Railway)

### Update Vercel Environment Variables

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Select your ChordyPi project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Update:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app
```

5. Redeploy frontend

## 🆚 Railway vs Render - Why Railway is Better

| Feature | Railway | Render |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Deployment Speed | ⚡ 2-3 min | 🐌 5-10 min |
| Caching Issues | ✅ Never | ❌ Frequent |
| Build Logs | 🔍 Crystal clear | 😕 Confusing |
| Environment Vars | 🎯 Instant update | ⏳ Requires redeploy |
| Python Support | 🚀 Excellent | ⚠️ Mediocre |
| Free Tier | 💪 $5 credit/month | 🤏 750 hours/month |

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Module not found" errors
**Solution**: Check Root Directory is set to `server`

### Issue: Port binding errors
**Solution**: Ensure `PORT` environment variable is set

### Issue: RapidAPI still not working
**Solution**: 
1. Check Railway logs for debug output
2. Verify `RAPIDAPI_KEY` is in Variables tab
3. Restart deployment

### Issue: CORS errors from frontend
**Solution**: Check `app.py` has proper CORS configuration:
```python
CORS(app, origins=["https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app"])
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

After successful deployment, you should see:

✅ **Backend logs show:**
```
🚀 APP.PY STARTING - ChordyPi v3.0 with RapidAPI
🔥 AUDIO_PROCESSOR.PY LOADED - VERSION 2 WITH RAPIDAPI DEBUG
Server running on port 5000
```

✅ **When analyzing songs:**
```
🔴 ABOUT TO CALL download_youtube_audio()
🎵 DOWNLOAD_YOUTUBE_AUDIO called for: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...
🚀 Trying RapidAPI YouTube MP3 Downloader...
✅ RapidAPI download successful!
🎸 Starting chord detection...
```

✅ **NO MORE:** `Sign in to confirm you're not a bot` errors!

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep Render running** until Railway is confirmed working (backup!)
2. **Monitor Railway logs** during first few song analyses
3. **Test with multiple songs** to confirm 100% success rate
4. **Update your README** with new Railway URL
5. **Add Railway badge** to show deployment status

---

## 🚨 If Railway Deployment Fails

### Plan B Options:

1. **Fly.io** - Similar to Railway, excellent Python support
2. **Heroku** - Classic platform, very reliable (no longer free)
3. **DigitalOcean App Platform** - More control, simple deployment
4. **Vercel Serverless Functions** - Deploy backend as serverless (requires refactoring)
