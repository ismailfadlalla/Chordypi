# Pi Network App Registration Guide

## Issue: Authentication Hanging Indefinitely

If clicking "Connect with Pi Network" shows "Connecting..." but never completes, your app likely needs to be registered in the **Pi Developer Portal**.

## Steps to Register Your App

### 1. Go to Pi Developer Portal
Visit: https://develop.pi

### 2. Create a New App
- Click "Create New App" or "Register App"
- Fill in the required information:
  - **App Name**: ChordyPi
  - **App Description**: AI-powered guitar chord learning platform
  - **App URL**: https://chordypi.vercel.app
  - **App Type**: Web Application
  - **Category**: Music & Entertainment / Education

### 3. Configure App Settings
- **Redirect URLs**: 
  - https://chordypi.vercel.app
  - https://chordypi.vercel.app/
- **Scopes Requested**:
  - ‚úÖ username (to identify users)
  - ‚úÖ payments (for premium features)

### 4. Get Your API Key
After registration, you'll receive:
- **App ID**: Copy this
- **API Key**: Copy this

### 5. Add API Key to Vercel Environment Variables
Go to: https://vercel.com/your-username/chordypi/settings/environment-variables

Add:
```
REACT_APP_PI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_PI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 6. Redeploy
After adding the environment variables:
1. Go to Vercel Deployments
2. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
3. Test authentication again in Pi Browser

## What Happens Without Registration?

Without registration in the Pi Developer Portal:
- ‚ùå `window.Pi.authenticate()` will hang indefinitely
- ‚ùå Pi Browser can't show the permission dialog
- ‚ùå postMessage communication fails
- ‚ùå Users can't authenticate

## After Registration

Once registered:
- ‚úÖ Pi Browser recognizes your app
- ‚úÖ Shows proper permission dialog to users
- ‚úÖ Authentication completes successfully
- ‚úÖ Users can make Pi payments

## Current Auto-Detection Settings

Your app now automatically detects:
- **Production mode** on `vercel.app` or `chordypi.com` domains
- **Sandbox mode** on `localhost` for development
- **30-second timeout** if authentication hangs

## Testing Checklist

After registration, test in Pi Browser:
1. ‚úÖ Click "Connect with Pi Network"
2. ‚úÖ See "Connecting..." loading state
3. ‚úÖ Pi Browser shows permission dialog
4. ‚úÖ Approve permissions
5. ‚úÖ See "‚úÖ Connected" status
6. ‚úÖ See your Pi username displayed

## Troubleshooting

### Still Hanging After Registration?
Check console logs for:
```
üåç Environment: production mode (isProduction: true)
‚è≥ Calling window.Pi.authenticate()...
‚è∞ Authentication is taking longer than expected (5+ seconds)...
```

### Error Messages
If you see timeout error after 30 seconds:
- Check network connectivity
- Verify app is approved in Pi Developer Portal
- Check API key is correctly set in Vercel
- Try clearing Pi Browser cache
