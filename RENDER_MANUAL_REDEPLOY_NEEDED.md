# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Render Needs Manual Redeploy

## Issue Detected

The Render logs show the OLD code is still running:
```
ERROR: [youtube] 6hzrDeceEKc: Sign in to confirm you're not a bot.
```

**Expected logs** (with new RapidAPI code):
```
ðŸš€ Trying RapidAPI YouTube MP3 Downloader (Method 1 - Best)
ðŸŽµ Video ID: 6hzrDeceEKc
ðŸ“¡ Calling RapidAPI YouTube MP3 Downloader...
```

## Solution: Manual Redeploy

### Steps:

1. **In Render Dashboard** (already open):
   - Click on your ChordyPi backend service

2. **Click "Manual Deploy"** button (top right corner)

3. **Select "Deploy latest commit"**
   - Latest commit: `4f54c3d` or `ff286d2`
   - Should say: "feat: Add RapidAPI YouTube downloader"

4. **Click "Deploy"**

5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete

6. **Check logs again** - should now see:
   ```
   ðŸš€ Trying RapidAPI YouTube MP3 Downloader (Method 1 - Best)
   ```

## Why This Happened

Render sometimes doesn't auto-deploy when:
- Multiple commits pushed quickly
- GitHub webhook delays
- Render's auto-deploy is paused

Manual deploy forces it to use latest code.

## After Redeploy

Test at https://chordypi.vercel.app:
1. Search "Wonderwall"
2. Click "Analyze Chords"
3. âœ… Should work perfectly!

The RapidAPI key is already set (you added it before), so once the new code deploys, everything will work! ðŸŽ¸
