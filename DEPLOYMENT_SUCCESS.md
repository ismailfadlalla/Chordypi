## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Wrong Service Type
- **Problem:** Service was configured as Docker instead of Python
- **Solution:** Actually, it worked! Render auto-detected Python from requirements.txt

### Issue 2: API Connection
- **Problem:** Frontend was trying to connect to localhost:5000
- **Solution:** Updated `client/src/utils/constants.js` to use production backend URL
- **Implementation:**
  ```javascript
  // Production: Uses https://chordypi.onrender.com/api
  // Local Dev: Uses localhost:5000
  ```

### Issue 3: vercel.json Configuration
- **Problem:** Backend URL was set to chordypi-api.onrender.com (incorrect)
- **Solution:** Updated to chordypi.onrender.com (correct)

## 🎯 Testing Your App

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment
- Vercel is currently redeploying
- Check status: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Wait for "Ready" status (1-2 minutes)

### Step 2: Test the Live App
1. Go to: https://chordypi.vercel.app
2. Sign up or sign in
3. Search for a song (e.g., "Gangnam Style")
4. Watch the AI chord detection work!

### Step 3: Verify Backend
- Test health endpoint: https://chordypi.onrender.com/api/health
- Should return:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "healthy",
    "service": "ChordyPi - AI Chord Detection API with Pi Network",
    "ffmpeg_available": true,
    "dependencies": {
      "librosa": true,
      "numpy": true,
      "yt_dlp": true
    }
  }
  ```

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. App shows "Failed to fetch" errors**
- Solution: Wait 60 seconds if backend was sleeping
- Check: https://chordypi.onrender.com/api/health

**2. Deployment not updating**
- Solution: Manually trigger redeploy in Vercel/Render dashboard
- Or: Push an empty commit to trigger auto-deploy

**3. Backend responds slowly**
- Reason: Render free tier spins down after 15 min
- Solution: First request wakes it up (30-60 sec)
