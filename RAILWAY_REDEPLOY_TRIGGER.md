# Railway Redeploy Trigger

**Date**: October 13, 2025
**Reason**: Force redeploy to apply CORS preflight fix

## Changes Applied
- Added OPTIONS handler in `@app.before_request`
- Returns proper CORS headers for preflight requests
- Should fix "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header" errors

## To Trigger Railway Redeploy:

### Option 1: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click on your `chordypi-production` project
3. Click on the service (Python backend)
4. Click **"Deploy"** → **"Redeploy"** button
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

### Option 2: Git Trigger (Automatic)
This file change will trigger auto-deploy if Railway is connected to GitHub.

### Option 3: Railway CLI
```bash
railway up
```

## Verify Fix
After redeployment, check:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Network tab
2. Visit https://chordypi.vercel.app
3. Try to analyze a song
4. Check for OPTIONS preflight request - should return 204 with CORS headers
5. POST request should succeed with 200

## Expected Result
✅ OPTIONS requests return 204 No Content with CORS headers
✅ POST requests succeed with 200 OK
✅ Analysis works without CORS errors
