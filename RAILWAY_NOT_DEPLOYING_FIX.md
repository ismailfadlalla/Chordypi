## ✅ How to Know It Worked

### In Railway:
1. **Deployments tab** shows new deployment
2. Status: **"Building..."** → **"Deploying..."** → **"Success"**
3. Latest commit shown: `b51fd69` or `34ed991`
4. Time: Shows recent timestamp (within last few minutes)

### Test It:
```powershell
curl https://chordypi-production.up.railway.app/api/health
```
Should return recent data

## 🚨 If Railway Shows Old Commit

Check what commit is currently deployed:
1. Railway → Deployments tab
2. Look at **"Active"** or **"Live"** deployment
3. Check commit hash
